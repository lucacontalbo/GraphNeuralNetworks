# GraphNeuralNetworks
This repository holds some experiments done while following the CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs course by Stanford University (youtube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&index=1)  

The repo is structured as follows:
- **node2vec** dir: holds an implementation of the node2vec algorithm followed by a small clustering example done using DBSCAN
